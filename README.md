Thunderstore Page: https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/SnailUSB/GRACEPLUS/

# Current Features:
- Will send a message in chat each time a GRACE round ends, telling you how long that round took.

# Future Features:
- Track your best times on each map
- Ghost player that replays your best time on a given stage

# How it works:
- The mod attaches itself to ACN, and then waits for a race to start.
- Once a race has started, it starts a timer that will track how long the race goes on for.
- Once the race is over, it will send a message in chat telling you how long that round took.
- This message can only be seen by you

- Future features will also have the mod check what stage you are on, and if you actually won or not.

# HOW TO BUILD:
- While the source code is all here, you will need to get the required DLLs for it yourself
