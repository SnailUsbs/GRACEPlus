*v1.1.3 source code will uploaded once I confirm I'm done with all of the bug patches needed for it*

# Current Features:
- **GRACE Time tracker:** You will get a message in chat telling you how long each GRACE round was, and if it beat your best time, automically each time a round ends.

- **Best time per map tracking system:** Your best times will be saved in a txt file, inside of the mod folder. They can be cleared all at once with */timeclearall* or you can clear the time of the map you are in by using */timeclear*.

- **GRACE Stats:** By using the */gracestats* command you can see your GRACE stats, including you win ratio. This will show you custom stats GRACEPlus recorded, and acn stats. Custom Stats are saved to a text file inside of the mod folder.

- **Custom Chat Messages:** You can now customize most of the messages that get sent chat. Including what gets sent, what variables are sent, etc. The only ones you cant change are the ones from commands. 

- **Save ALL Match Results To A Text File:** This is an option that has to be enabled in the config, but when it is enabled it will save every grace match result to a text file in the mod folder with a time stamp, if you won or lost, the type of grace gamemode, and of course the time it took for the round to end

# Commands:
- **/showbest** : will show your best time of the map you are currently in
- **/timeclear** : Will delete your best time of the map you are currently in
- **/timeclearall** : Will delete your best time on all maps
- **/gracestats** : will show you your GRACE stats

# Future Features:

- reset props at the start of each round
- Ghost player that replays your best time on a given stage

# v1.1.2 Change log:
- **Chat Messages Have Been Reworked:** Chat messages are now a lot better, with a lot more than just one when the round ends

- **Best time per map tracking system**
- **GRACE Stats**
- **Custom Chat Messages**
- **Save ALL Match Results To A Text File**

# HOW TO BUILD:
- While the source code is all here, you will need to get the required DLLs for it yourself
